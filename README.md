# Statistical analysis of community transmission of COVID-19 in New York City

Code and data for the statistical analysis in Pei et al. Contact tracing reveals community transmission of COVID-19 in New York City, Nature Communications (2022).

The code performs Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with random effects and uses conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors to account for the inherent spatial-temporal autocorrelation in disease transmission data. For introduction of this method, please see: Lee, D., Rushworth, A. & Napier, G. Spatio-Temporal Areal Unit Modeling in R with Conditional Autoregressive Priors Using the CARBayesST Package. J. Stat. Softw. 84, 1â€“39 (2018). The code also runs Moran's I test and the Durbin-Watson test on residues.
